///! Stabilizer ADC management interface
///!
///! The Stabilizer ADCs utilize a DMA channel to trigger sampling. The SPI streams are configured
///! for full-duplex operation, but only RX is connected to physical pins. A timer channel is
///! configured to generate a DMA write into the SPI TXFIFO, which initiates a SPI transfer and
///! results in an ADC sample read for both channels.
///!
///! In order to read multiple samples without interrupting the CPU, a separate DMA transfer is
///! configured to read from each of the ADC SPI RX FIFOs. Due to the design of the SPI peripheral,
///! these DMA transfers stall when no data is available in the FIFO. Thus, the DMA transfer only
///! completes after all samples have been read. When this occurs, a CPU interrupt is generated so
///! that software can process the acquired samples from both ADCs. Only one of the ADC DMA streams
///! is configured to generate an interrupt to handle both transfers, so it is necessary to ensure
///! both transfers are completed before reading the data. This is usually not significant for
///! busy-waiting because the transfers should complete at approximately the same time.
